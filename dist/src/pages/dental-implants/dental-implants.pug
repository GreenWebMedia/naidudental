          h2 An Overview of Dental Implants
          p
            | Dental implants are the most advanced and comfortable way to replace missing teeth. They are increasingly popular because they provide a permanent solution that functions, looks, and feels like your own natural teeth.
          p
            | Dental implants have lightweight titanium root forms that are surgically placed into the jawbone. As the bone heals, it bonds with the root form, integrating it and providing a strong base that can support a custom porcelain crown. The entire structure is solid and durable enough to anchor bridges and partial or complete dentures.
          p
            | One of the advantages of replacing missing teeth with dental implants is that the root forms help preserve the jawbone itself. Without tooth roots, the jawbone is naturally absorbed by the body, which can lead to facial collapse and the inability to wear traditional dentures.
          h2 The Bradenton Dental Implant Process
          p
            | Dr. Naidu will begin by listening to and addressing your ideas and concerns. He will then get a complete medical history to ensure that you are a good candidate for dental implants and will plan out where the implants need to be placed.
          p
            | Dr. Naidu will then arrange for a three-dimensional CT scan to show the exact placement of the nerves, blood vessels, and nasal sinuses and the amount and quality of bone support available. He will refer to this information when he surgically places the root forms. Even if you have less than optimal bone structure, Dr. Naidu with his multi speciality surgical colleagues can perform bone grafting to provide a solid placement for implants.
          p
            | After your implants have integrated with the bone, Dr. Naidu will restore them. He will create porcelain crowns or dentures that have the same depth of transparency and color variations found in natural teeth.
          p
            | Caring for your dental implants is the same as caring for your natural teeth. You will continue to brush and floss and get regular checkups. The result can feel like having your own teeth back again.

          h2 Choosing Implant-Supported Dentures
          p
            | If you choose to have dental implants to secure any form of dentures, the results can have significant advantages. To begin with, the dentures will be supported by the implanted root forms, making them feel solid and secure. Youâ€™ll be able to eat normally. It will be like having your own natural teeth back. They will also leave your hard palate free, giving you better articulation in speech and a better eating experience. In addition, the implants will prevent the absorption of your jawbone that always occurs when there are no natural teeth. To learn more about traditional dentures, visit our
