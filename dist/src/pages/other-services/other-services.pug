            | Dr. Naidu’s signature smile makeovers are based on a multi-phase approach. He begins with the final goal by listening closely to your ideas and desires. Together, you will create a smile design that will provide a clear vision of the outcome. This way, he can ensure that your new smile will be everything you hoped for.

            strong Phase I: Diagnosis
            br
            | The first phase is to determine what elements will be part of your smile makeover. You will receive a comprehensive exam, complete with digital x-rays, intra-oral and extra-oral photos, impressions of your mouth, and a bite analysis to determine your level of function. In addition, Dr. Naidu will work with a highly trained lab technician to create a waxed up version of the final vision for your smile to serve as a foundation to build on.
          p
            strong Phase 2: Restoration
            br
            | After the diagnostic phase Dr. Naidu will communicate his findings with you and begin a restorative phase to bring your teeth and gums back to optimal health. During this phase, he will use some combination of the following elements:

            | During phase 3 Dr. Naidu will place your final restorations in a systematic manner. At this point, you can expect to achieve:
            br
            | A healthier, more aesthetic smile
            br

          h2 Extractions
          p
            | There are some circumstances where a tooth cannot be saved despite our best efforts. This can be due to extensive decay, severe trauma, advanced gum disease leading to bone loss around the tooth, or badly cracked teeth. Dr. Naidu is committed to a comfortable and pain free process of tooth removal and offers nitrous sedation as well as conscious sedation (insert links) to help with anxiety. In addition Dr. Naidu will provide solutions to replace the missing tooth/teeth
            a(name='crowns')
            |  with crowns, bridges, or implants, depending on your needs.
          h2 Dental Crowns
          p
            | Crowns are an ideal restoration for teeth that are severely decayed, cracked, or broken, and for covering covering severe discolorations from previous trauma or staining. Crowns can be shaped and colored to closely resemble your natural teeth, and they improve the strength and longevity of the affected tooth.
          p
            img.alignleft.size-full.wp-image-454(src='../../assets/images/dental-crown.jpg', alt='drawing-of-dental-crown')
            | First the affected tooth is cleaned thoroughly and any decayed areas are removed. The tooth is then shaped to allow room for the crown to fit. An impression is then taken and then sent to a dental laboratory to be used for the construction of your crown. The drawing to the left shows how a tooth is prepared and then covered with a crown.
          p
            | During the construction phase a temporary crown is fabricated in the office that is strong and tooth colored and will protect the area during your final crown fabrication. After the final crown is completed. Dr. Naidu will remove your temporary and cement your final crown in with a permanent cement that will seal the tooth

          h2 Dental Bridges
          p
            | Dental bridges are a permanent solution to replacing a missing tooth or multiple teeth. A bridge is compromised of multiple crowns, usually three, and sometimes more, that are fused together.
          p
            img.alignleft.size-full.wp-image-458(src='../../assets/images/dental-bridge.jpg', alt='drawing-of-a-dental-bridge')
            | The bridge appliance is made up of two crowns and a false tooth that is fused between them. To prepare the site, the teeth adjacent to the missing tooth are precisely shaped to be fitted with crowns, and an impression is taken and sent to the dental laboratory. The drawing to the left shows the false tooth suspended from and fused to two crowns.
          p
            | A strong temporary, tooth-colored bridge is fabricated in the office that matches the size and color of your existing teeth, and you will wear this until your permanent bridge arrives. Then Dr. Naidu will remove the temporary bridge and cement the bridge in permanently. This will then restore function and allow you to chew food more efficiently and give you the cosmetic benefit of replacing

          h2 Dentures

            img.alignleft.size-full.wp-image-476(src='../../assets/images/dentures.jpg', alt='photo-of-upper-and-lower-dentures')
            | Dentures are a treatment option for missing teeth and surrounding tissues. Dentures can be either full coverage if all teeth are missing or partial coverage using existing teeth for support and retention. Dr. Naidu will carefully assess your needs and create the best possible removable appliance to restore form, function, and aesthetics.
          p
            | He will also take the time to do an in-depth bite and smile analysis and carefully design your denture using the most natural looking teeth for the best cosmetic result possible. There are three types of dentures that can be delivered:
          p
            | 1) Conventional Full denture: An appliance that is placed in your mouth after all your teeth have been removed, and your gums have fully healed healed. The photo above shows a set of conventional dentures.
          p
            | 2) Immediate Denture: An appliance that is placed in your mouth immediately after non-salvageable teeth are extracted and will allow for some function. This is a temporary appliance that is used only as the gums heal. A final denture may be needed once the healing process has been completed for a better fit and function.
          p
            img.alignright.size-full.wp-image-480(src='../../assets/images/partial-denture.jpg', alt='partial-denture-photo')
            | 3) Removable Partial Denture: An appliance that restores missing teeth by using clasps to attach to any other remaining teeth that are healthy. Sometimes crowns on existing teeth that are healthy may be needed to serve as anchors for better retention for your removable partial denture. Dr. Naidu will carefully examine all viable teeth with a comprehensive evaluation before determining the final treatment plan for the best fitting partial denture possible.

          h2 Root Canal Therapy
          p
            | According to the American Association of Endodontists, root canal therapy is the most feared dental procedure of all. This stigma comes from older technology and anesthesia methods that weren’t as effective as they needed to be. Dr. Naidu is very aware of this and has invested in state-of-the-art root canal instruments and anesthesia methods to make the procedure as comfortable as possible.
          p
            img.alignleft.size-full.wp-image-461(src='../../assets/images/tooth-abcess.jpg', alt='drawing-of-tooth-abcess')
            | A root canal is needed when there is severe decay or trauma to a tooth that affects the nerve area near the root, usually causing significant pain, as shown in the diagram. If left untreated the nerve damage can result in a dental abscess that could be potentially life threatening and requires immediate attention. The drawing to the left shows where abscesses usually form.
          p
            | During a root canal treatment Dr. Naidu will ensure the tooth is numb with the best anesthetics and procedures, and he will isolate it from bacteria. The diseased or dead tissue inside the tooth will be removed and replaced with a filling material after careful disinfection using antibacterial solutions. The tooth will then be restored with a crown to regain

          h2 Porcelain Veneers
          p
            | Porcelain veneer treatment is a great way to enhance your smile in a short period of time. The process is very conservative and the outcome can make a big difference in your smile, giving you greater self-confidence and a more youthful appearance by covering the wear and tear that comes with time.
          p
            img.alignleft.size-full.wp-image-474(src='../../assets/images/porcelain-veneer.jpg', alt='photo-of-a-porcelain-veneer')
            | Dr. Naidu’s signature veneer treatment starts with high quality photography of your existing teeth. Your teeth will then be conservatively prepared to allow room for the porcelain veneers. Impressions will be taken and sent to Dr. Naidu’s dental laboratory, which will create the final veneers. And temporary veneers will be prepared in the office for you to wear while the permanent ones are being crafted. The photo to the left shows a porcelain veneer.
          p
            | When the final veneers are completed Dr. Naidu will attach them to your teeth very precisely,
            a(name='white-fillings')
            |  using the strongest bonding procedures to achieve the final transformation.
          h2 White Fillings
          p
            img.alignleft.size-full.wp-image-484(src='../../assets/images/white-filling-before.jpg', alt='teeth-before-white-fillings', width='160', height='104')
            img.alignright.size-full.wp-image-486(src='../../assets/images/white-filling-after.jpg', alt='white-fillings-after')
            | White composite fillings are a great alternative to “silver” amalgam fillings for many reasons. White fillings match your existing teeth in color and will require less tooth preparation for a more conservative result. The photos above show silver amalgam fillings and white composite fillings in the same teeth, before and after.
          p
            | The composite material is made up of acrylic and glass particles, and it contains no mercury or other metals. In addition, due to the flexibility of the material it reduces the development of cracks and fractures commonly associated with metal fillings.
          p
            | Dr. Naidu uses the best composite material on the market, containing both strength and cosmetic properties, and he uses the latest bonding protocol to minimize postoperative sensitivity.
