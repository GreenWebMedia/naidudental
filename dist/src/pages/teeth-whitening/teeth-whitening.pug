            | The Sapphire professional teeth whitening system is a quick and effective way to brighten your smile in just one visit. And the whitening effect is permanent—once you have the treatment, your teeth will always be whiter than they were before.

            | Coffee, tea, wine, tobacco, and brightly pigmented foods all release pigment molecules that stain your teeth during your life. If those stains remained on the surface of the enamel of your teeth, regular cleanings would remove them. But these types of stains are absorbed into the enamel and dentin.
          p
            | Only a very strong peroxide that is absorbed into the enamel and dentin can oxidize, or bleach, those stains out. That’s why over-the-counter teeth whitening products are ineffective. Toothpastes are not on your teeth long enough to be absorbed, and the strips and trays sold over-the-counter use weaker peroxide solutions because they are used without the supervision of a dentist. Some of those products can even damage your enamel.
          h2 What to Expect with the Sapphire Teeth Whitening System
          p
            | With the Sapphire teeth whitening system, Dr. Naidu and his staff will make sure you are comfortable, protect the soft tissue in and around your mouth, and apply a strong peroxide bleaching gel to your teeth. As this gel is absorbed into your teeth, a special light activates the peroxide so that it releases oxygen, removing the stains. At the end of the appointment, your teeth will be dramatically whiter. Then, to stabilize the whitening, he will give you a set of trays to wear with bleaching gel at home.
          p
            | Over time, your teeth will still be susceptible to staining, so it’s a good idea, if you want maximum whiteness, to touch-up the bleaching with these trays maybe once a year or so.
          h2 Choosing the Sapphire System
          p
            | There are other light-enhanced teeth whitening systems, but Dr. Naidu has chosen the Sapphire system because he feels the outcomes are better and it is a gentler on patients than Zoom whitening, for example. The Sapphire system filters out the infrared spectrum of the light, so it doesn’t heat your teeth, which can lead to tooth sensitivity and zinging feelings after treatment.
          p
            | Dr. Naidu also offers custom-fit trays and bleaching gel for at-home teeth whitening. This method is just as effective as the Sapphire system. It is slower, however, and does require a commitment to wear the trays regularly during the day or at night for a longer period of time and requires more than one office visit.
