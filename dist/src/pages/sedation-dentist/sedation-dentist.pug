            | Dr. Darshan Naidu knows that at least a third of all Americans suffer from some kind of dental fear. And he knows that it can be absolutely terrifying to contemplate a dental appointment after you’ve had a bad experience or after years of neglect.
          p
            | If you cannot imagine easily going to the dentist for regular dental care, Dr. Naidu can help you. In fact, he really enjoys working with fearful people and sees it as a rewarding undertaking to help his patients transform their lives by eliminating dental anxiety.

          h2 Nitrous Oxide
          p
            | Nitrous oxide can help people with mild anxiety. It is a kind of sedation that is mixed with oxygen and breathed in through a nose mask. It can increase the effectiveness of novocaine and help you release any stress you may feel. After your procedure is complete, the sedation is removed from the mix and you will breathe oxygen for a couple minutes.
          p
            | The advantage of using nitrous oxide is that you will have no after-effects, leaving you free to drive and return to your activities after your appointment.
          h2 Oral Conscious Sedation
          p
            | Dr. Naidu offers a deeper level of conscious sedation with a pill you will take before your appointment. This will induce a relaxed and sleepy state that will help you remain indifferent through your appointment. Again, you will be conscious and responsive but probably won’t remember anything.

            br
            | With oral sedation, you’ll need to have someone drive you to and from Dr. Naidu’s office, because it will not be safe for you to drive yourself.
          h2 You Deserve Our Respect
          p
            | At Dr. Naidu’s practice, we’ll treat you with the respect you deserve. You won’t be lectured or pressured or made to feel that there is something wrong with you. After all, coming to your appointment is sometimes a very formidable challenge that takes great courage. We want to make you feel comfortable once you’re here.
